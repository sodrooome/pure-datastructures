# Pure-datastructures

Data structures package for python, written in pure python code, not dependent on any other libraries or built-in function. Any performance is not measured enough (or you can benchmark yourself using cProfile). Even though, i'm pretty confident this scenarios are using Big-O-Notation references (average - worst scenario for time complexity).

## List of Data Structures
