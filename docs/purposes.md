# Why this package? Are you mad or something?

Actually, in real-world scenario, this package is seem meaningless. For example if you use it in web programming, concepts such as Stack, List, or Queue are bundled when you initialize queries in the database. All you need to do is how the query works and modify it as needed.

The purpose of making this package is, basically only for documentation in implementing data structures (or you can tell it, learning purposes only or for education), then gradually changes to make it a package where this package will be modular and dependency-injection to other programs, as long as it's still in python environment.

So what's **the difference** between this package with other packages or built-in functions?

This package comes to minimal and clean implementation, thus, we do not use the help of built-in functions such as `pop`, `insert`, or other methods or decorators, and also modules (python comes it handy with data structures module) but from the beginning this package will be written  in pure python code, instead using `pop` or something like that, we want to write an abstract base class then inherit it into some function, or make it a decorator (although i'm not really sure for implementing abstract classes, do you need a module or just make it yourself).

The biggest difference in this package i think is that, in the meantime, this package can be override and anyone who uses can customize it for themselves while learning and understanding how data structures can work from scratch, and thats why this documentation exists.
